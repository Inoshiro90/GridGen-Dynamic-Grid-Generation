# GridGen â€“ Dynamic Grid Generation

## Project Description  
GridGen is a web-based tool designed to generate more natural-looking city maps for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). Traditional square grids often appear too rigid and artificial, which can disrupt the immersive experience of world-building.  

To address this, GridGen introduces **point displacement based on rotation patterns**, allowing users to create dynamic and organic layouts. By adjusting grid dimensions and point spacing, users can design unique and varied map structures that better reflect natural city growth.  

The generated maps can be exported as **SVG or PNG** files, making them easy to integrate into virtual tabletop platforms or print for physical use.
